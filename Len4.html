Now that you understand focal length and aperture, you can read lens titles and know what they mean. Let's take the standard zoom lens you already have and break it down. Most likely it has a label of 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 (or something like that). You know the first part, 18-55mm, means the lens can capture a view as wide as 18mm and zoom in as close as 55mm. You know the second part, f/3.5-5.6, means that the lens has a maximum aperture of f/3.5 when zoomed out to 18mm and f/5.6 when zoomed in to 55mm. But what does that mean in practical use? For that you need to understand what different types of lenses can do.
