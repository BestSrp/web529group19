<h1>Learn the Lens Basics</h1></br>
Before we get into the various types of lenses, 
it's important to know a few terms and basic ideas about lenses 
so that you can understand what they mean when you're shopping around.
 Lenses don't have fun names, but rather are labeled like this: 
 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6. That designation tells you a lot, 
 but doesn't mean much if you don't know a few terms. 
 In this section we'll learn what you need to know 
 to understand how lenses are labeled and what those labels mean.
