<h1>Zoom Lenses vs. Prime Lenses</h1></br>
It's important to know the difference between zoom lenses and prime lenses. 
A zoom lens does what you might expect: it zooms in and out, 
allowing you to magnify your subject. A prime lens can't zoom.
 If you want to move closer or farther away with a prime, 
 you move your legs rather than turning a zoom ring on the barrel (i.e. the body) 
 of the lens. Why would anyone prefer a prime to a zoom? 
 Primes are often cheaper, offer sharper results, 
 have wider apertures (which means they can take in more light, 
 thus performing better in low light situations), 
 and generally handle their specific function better than a zoom.
 That said, for enough money a zoom can perform just as well 
 and offers more versatility. Obviously you have an advantage 
 if you don't have to constantly change lenses. 
 Zooms allow you to essentially change the lens, 
 and therefore the type of shot you're getting, by zooming in or out. 
 Primes do not.Both zoom and prime lenses are designated by their focal length. 
 Focal length is often measured in millimeters (mm) 
 and designates the distance at which something is in focus.
 This definition doesn't mean much practically speaking, 
 so what you want to remember about focal distance is 
 that lower numbers indicate a wider view (zoomed out) 
 and larger numbers indicate a closer view (zoomed in).
 For example, if you're photographing a small room in a house 
 and you used an 18mm lens you'd likely capture the majority 
 of the room in your image and you'd get very little of the room with an 85mm lens. 
 Primes only have one focal length, and so they're simply labeled as 35mm, 50mm, 
 and so on. Zooms offer a range, and so they're labeled as 18-55,
 indicating that you can achieve a focal length as wide as 18mm, 
 as close as 55mm, and everything in between.
